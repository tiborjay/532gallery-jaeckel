The rabbit—rendered with quiet attentiveness—functions as both subject and symbol, evoking vulnerability, intuition, and cyclical renewal. Nguyen surrounds the figure with translucent arcs, floating botanical motifs, and particulate marks that suggest motion without urgency, as if time itself has softened. Working on Mylar allows light to pass through the composition, activating layers of drawing, pigment, and photographic reference into a single, breathing surface. The image oscillates between the microscopic and the infinite, inviting the viewer to read the rabbit simultaneously as a creature of the earth and a celestial traveler—an emissary between fragile ecosystems and expansive, unseen realms.",

    "blurb": "In Cosmic Owl Light, Nguyen presents the owl as a contemplative presence suspended within a radiant, atmospheric space. Traditionally associated with perception, knowledge, and nocturnal awareness, the owl appears here not as a predator, but as a guardian—perched within a nest-like vortex of line, light, and drifting organic forms. The composition unfolds vertically, drawing the eye upward through layers of translucent color, gestural arcs, and subtle constellations of mark-making. The Mylar surface enhances the sensation of weightlessness, allowing light to refract across overlapping elements and creating a sense of depth that feels both underwater and cosmic. The work invites prolonged looking, rewarding stillness with the impression that the image itself is slowly breathing, watching, and holding space.",

    "blurb": "Cosmic Blue Flower Light centers on a radiant, multi-petaled bloom that appears to float between states of emergence and dissolution. Rendered in cool blues and softened linework, the flower becomes a conduit through which light, memory, and energy circulate. Rather than depicting a specific species, Nguyen abstracts botanical form into a symbolic structure—part organism, part cosmic diagram. Surrounding arcs, floating points, and subtle chromatic shifts create the impression of a living system in motion, as if the flower is both receiving and transmitting energy across space. The translucency of Mylar amplifies this effect, allowing layers to hover rather than settle. The work reflects Nguyen’s ongoing exploration of nature as a portal—where minute physical details open onto expansive, meditative visions of interconnectedness.",
