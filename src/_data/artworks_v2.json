      "Lily Prince’s plein air-inspired works translate observational landscapes into personal expressions of universal significance, viewing beauty as a form of protest amid environmental and societal challenges. Combining direct perception, memory, and aspiration, her watercolor, gouache, and oil pastel pieces create fresh vistas that feel familiar yet surprising, drawing from terrains like the American West, Italy, and New York’s Hudson Valley. Prince was born in 1962 and is based in New York and the Hudson Valley. She received her BFA from Rhode Island School of Design and her MFA from Bard College, with a residency at Skowhegan. Prince has had solo exhibitions linked to residencies at Olana and BAU Institute, Italy.
