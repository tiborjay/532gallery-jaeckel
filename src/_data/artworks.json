The results combine ferocious visual energy with a whimsical, mysterious sensibility redolent with evocative imagery drawn from an abundant imagination.",

Gonella takes the dynamic a step further in that his works are created for the use of the viewer; “Whispers in the Twilight” comprises a public theatre of sorts.",
      "The first element in this visual carnival is the nearly aggressively crude and gestural signifiers that Gonella constructs. Using a salmagundi of paints and colors, liquids, crayons, oil stick, enamel and found materials — literally mixed media — Gonella populates his canvases with sketched-out outlines of stick figures with primitive faces, while objects are depicted in assertively flat renditions."
